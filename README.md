### e. Service Architecture & Database Structure

#### **Current Client-Side Architecture:**
```
React Frontend (Vite Build)
        ↓
Component State Management (useState/useEffect)
        ↓
Browser LocalStorage (JSON persistence)
```

#### **Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: number;          // Unique timestamp-based identifier
  title: string;       // Task description/title
  deadline?: string;   // Optional ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD)
  completed: boolean;  // Task completion status
  createdAt: string;   // ISO timestamp of task creation
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; // Task priority level
  estimatedTime?: number; // Optional estimated completion time
  actualTime?: number;    // Optional actual time spent
}

// Storage Implementation
localStorage.setItem('student-todo-tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks))
```

#### **Component Architecture:**
```
App.tsx (Main Container & State Manager)
├── components/
│   ├── TaskForm.tsx      (Create new tasks)
│   ├── TaskList.tsx      (Display & manage task list)
│   ├── TaskFilter.tsx    (Search & filter functionality)
│   ├── CalendarView.tsx  (Calendar-based task view)
│   ├── StatsView.tsx     (Analytics & productivity insights)
│   └── EditTaskModal.tsx (Task editing modal)
└── App.css (Comprehensive styling)
```

#### **Future Scalable Architecture (for production):**
```
React Frontend
        ↓
API Gateway (Express.js/Fastify)
        ↓
Database Layer (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
        ↓
Cloud Storage (AWS S3/Firebase)
        ↓
Authentication (Auth0/Firebase Auth)
```
