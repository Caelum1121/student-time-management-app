const estimateTaskTime = (taskTitle: string): number => {
  // Natural language processing for task complexity
  // Historical data analysis for accuracy
}
```

### Productivity Analytics AI
```typescript
// Pattern recognition and insights
const generateProductivityAnalysis = () => {
  // Identifies peak performance hours
  // Detects procrastination patterns
  // Suggests optimization strategies
}
```
